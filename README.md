## Robot_Arm_Project

### Project Description

In this project, we made an articulated robot arm which can be controlled through a few potentiometers. It is designed so that different toolheads can be easily swapped in and out, making use of magnets, meaning it can be used to pick up things, draw with a pencil, grab things with a magnet, or just about anything else. Other toolheads can be easily designed in the future, and be used for all kinds of applications.

Materials used:
- 3 180Â° degree servos
- 3 potentiometers
- battery pack
- 4 magnets for the head, and 4 more for each attachment
- arduino uno
- 8 standoffs
- breadboard
- wires
- 4-40 bolts, nuts, and locknuts
- lasercutter and 3D printer

### Code and Wiring

```python
#include <Servo.h>

Servo servo1;
Servo servo2;
Servo servo3;

int pin1 = 9;
int pin2 = 10;
int pin3 = 11;

int pot1 = A0;
int pot2 = A1;
int pot3 = A2;

double state1 = 90;
double state2 = 90;
double state3 = 90;

double buffer = 50;
int delayLength = 5;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  servo1.attach(pin1);
  servo2.attach(pin2);
  servo3.attach(pin3);
}

void loop() {
  //servo 1
  state1 = analogRead(pot1);
  state1 = map(state1, 0, 1023, 1000, 13500); //map() only returns int, so map to a multiple of 100 and divide to get decimals
  state1 /= 100;
  servo1.write(state1);
  Serial.print(state1);
  Serial.print("     ");
  //servo2
  state2 = analogRead(pot2);
  state2 = map(state2, 0, 1023, 1000, 13500);
  state2 /= 100;
  servo2.write(state2);
  Serial.print(state2);
  Serial.print("     ");
  //servo3
  state3 = analogRead(pot3);
  state3 = map(state3, 0, 1023, 2000, 13500);
  state3 /= 100;
  servo3.write(state3);
  Serial.println(state3);
}
```

### Reflection

In the end, the project is fully functional, and actually moves very smoothly. It took a while to get the movement to be smooth, though, because the servos kept jittering back and forth. After a few different solutions, a lot of troubleshooting, and a complete transition from using CircuitPython and the Metro boards to using Arduino, we found a good solution. We simplified the code a bunch, and that combined with good use of the ```map()``` function resulted in just about zero jittering in all of the servos.

We didn't run into too many issues with CAD, though we did have to find a solution to our goal of being able to easily swap the toolheads. We ended up settling on using magnets, and implementing them was realitively straightforward. The main linkage of our arm is based off of [this design](https://grabcad.com/library/modular-electromagnetic-robot-arm-1), though we have either edited or replaced most of the parts to customize them for our needs, or to be more efficiently fabricated. This linkage provides a smooth control system for the arm with only two potentiometers, while allowing for a large range of motion and keeping the head level with the ground.

Overall, I think that this project was pretty successful. It moves well in 3 dimensions, can complete an assortment of tasks, and the head can be easily swapped. It would have been cool if the heads were automatically interchangeable and didn't require human interference, but the system we have is pretty seamless.

## PID_Box

### Project Description

In this project, we aimed to create a self-adjusting spinning wheel using a rotary encoder and photointerrupter. We implemented the PID control algorithm to regulate its speed towards a setpoint. We chose a simple PID box and wheel in order to make the project as simple as possible so that we could do it within the short timeframe we were given.

Materials used:

- 1 lcd screen and backpack
- 1 rotary encoder
- 6v battery pack
- 2 switches
- Metro
- standoffs
- breadboard
- wires
- 4-40 bolts, nuts, and locknuts
- lasercutter and 3D printer
- led
- dc motor

### Reflection

At this point our project is functional, but due to it's many problems, it doesn't work as well or as smoooth as I would like. Although we ran into many problems along the way, I still feel like I learned some new valuable information. For example, when we went to plug in the lcd, we came across a problem where the lcd's 5v logic pins drew too much power and prevented the metro from properly initializing since the metros run their logic on 3.3v. This [repo](https://github.com/Helmstk1/CircuitPython#how-to-fix-the-lcd-power-issue-with-metro-m4-boards) from Mr. H goes into depth on the fix, but in summary, the fix involves adding a switch to your wiring and a few lines to your code that prevent the metro from running the i2c code until after it has properly booted. Another problem we ran into was issues with specific components and their wiring. The solution to this was in my opinion very cool, we created many small test suites for each component we suspected had issues, and used only the code that ran those components in order to eliminate all other potential error.

In terms of CAD, we ran into very few problems, and overall I was very pleased with how the design turned out. The standoff based design allowed for incredibly easy modification and iteration, something I took advantage of when I forgot that we needed a battery pack. One major issue we faced when designing/building was wiring, due to our vertical design, much of our wiring was compressed and shoved in hard to reach areas. If I were to do this project again, I would make sure that all of the components were on the same vertical plane as the metro and breadboard.

As a whole, I am pretty satisfied in our project, although most of the satisfaction comes from the things I learned and figured out in the process, less from the final product. Even though I know I could have done better I am still happy that we were able to get a somewhat working product, as well as learn the fundemental concepts surrounding PID and PID tuning.
